# X/Twitter Digest Reference

Use this reference when implementing, auditing, or troubleshooting the X/Twitter digest data collection workflow.

## Default Source Rule

Default daily digest source is automatic. If saved API credentials exist, normal digest requests use API. If no API credentials exist, normal digest requests use browser collection. For a normal digest request or a short confirmation such as "生成日报", "日报", "要", "继续", "好", or "可以", run the wrapper with no source override:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py
```

Source choice is recalculated on every run. It is not sticky. A previous browser run, visible-DM run, or assistant statement such as "浏览器源" must not make the next normal digest use browser. A previous API run also does not require a special follow-up command; the next normal digest still runs the wrapper with no source override and uses API when credentials are saved. Always collect again for a new digest request before reading `digest-context.*`; do not reuse a prior run context.

When API is configured, do not use browser source because a previous assistant message mentioned browser mode, because API excludes DMs, because browser could be more complete, or because API output says DM needs browser confirmation. Those are data gaps to report after API collection, not permission to switch sources. When API is not configured, the same wrapper command uses browser collection.

When API is configured, use browser source only when the latest user message itself explicitly asks for browser mode, visible DMs / private messages, X Chat, local browser collection, or a literal `--source browser`.

## Access Model

The data collection layer has three scripts:

- `scripts/browser_x_digest.py`: local browser collector. It launches a dedicated Chromium profile at `twitter-digest/.state/chrome-profile`, reads X page DOM, and is required for X Chat / DM content.
- `scripts/api_x_digest.py`: official API collector. It uses saved OAuth2 user-context credentials, `X_BEARER_TOKEN` / `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`, or `--bearer-token` and writes the same `digest-input.*` shape as the browser collector.
- `scripts/run_daily_digest.py`: upper wrapper. Default source is auto: use API when credentials are configured, use browser when API is not configured, and reconfigure API when saved credentials are broken. Use browser source explicitly when API is configured and the latest user instruction requests browser collection.

Browser mode:

- The user logs in to X once in the dedicated browser profile.
- Later runs default to headless collection and reuse the saved browser session.
- If saved login is unavailable, the script opens a visible browser window for manual login.
- The script reads visible content from X pages.

API mode:

- Intended for stable public-data collection.
- Requires user-context authorization for user-owned timelines. App-only keys are not enough for home timeline reliability.
- Reads the official reverse chronological home timeline when the token has user-context timeline access.
- Normal daily runs use API when API credentials are configured and do not collect DMs. If API is not configured, normal daily runs use browser collection. Browser collection is also required for visible X Chat / encrypted DM content.
- Records endpoint-level API failures as data gaps instead of silently treating them as empty pages.
- When API is explicitly selected or saved API credentials exist, authentication/configuration failures trigger API configuration and one retry from the main command. Permissions, tier limits, rate limits, and endpoint failures do not fall back to browser.
- Saved OAuth tokens are configured by the agent-triggered `run_daily_digest.py --configure-api` flow or lazily by `run_daily_digest.py` when collection needs credentials. OAuth2 PKCE is the supported path for user-owned local X Apps: the user provides the Client ID, authorizes the app in the browser, and the script saves the access token plus refresh token. OAuth2 tokens are refreshed automatically when a refresh token is saved.

Chat-triggered API setup:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --configure-api
```

The user should only interact with the system prompts and X OAuth browser page. Do not require the user to export env vars or paste tokens into shell history.
After configuration, verify saved credentials only with the built-in command:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/twitter-digest/scripts/configure_api.py --verify
```

Do not write ad-hoc `python3 -c` snippets or temporary verification scripts in chat. The built-in verifier calls `/users/me`, backfills `handle` / `user_id`, and does not print the token.

Typical chat run:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py
```

Visible DM collection is not part of API mode. This is a data gap in normal API digests. Use browser source only when the latest user message explicitly wants browser-visible X Chat / DM content.

Optional keyword search is off by default. Use it only when the user explicitly asks:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --keywords "query one,query two"
```

Force a visible browser window only for explicit browser debugging:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --source browser --headed
```

For unattended scheduled runs that should not open a visible browser or wait on passcode recovery:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --non-interactive
```

Force an API data source:

```bash
X_BEARER_TOKEN=... python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --source api --handle <handle>
```

Outputs:

- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-input.json`: raw collector capture.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-input.md`: readable raw collector capture.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-context.json`: normalized current-run facts.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-context.md`: primary final summary input. Read this first.

Normal summary writing must not use ad-hoc `python3 -c`, shell, or temporary scripts to inspect JSON structure. If the agent needs a low-sensitive count/status view, use:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/inspect_digest.py
```

This prints counts, load status, and data gaps without printing DM message bodies. Use it instead of writing custom inspection snippets.

## Browser Collection Rules

- Use the dedicated profile, not the user's normal browser profile.
- Do not ask the user to copy cookies or tokens.
- If X shows a login page, wait for the user to log in manually.
- If X shows CAPTCHA or account challenge, stop and ask the user to resolve it in the browser.
- Browser daily digest collection must identify the authenticated handle before collecting `own_profile`, `mentions_search`, and `mentions_notifications`. If headless detection fails, retry in a visible browser. If detection still fails, stop the run; do not let the agent summarize partial browser data as a daily digest.
- Do not post, like, follow, accept DM requests, open suspicious links, or reply.
- Keep scrolling bounded by the digest goal. API public collection defaults to `--max-public-items 300`; browser public collection defaults to `--scrolls 40`, `--max-public-items 100`, and `--public-window-hours 24`, stopping early when loaded post timestamps are clearly outside the daily window.
- Read only DM content that is visible in the local logged-in browser. Use `--no-dms` when the user does not want DMs processed.
- If X Chat shows passcode setup, passcode entry, or encryption-key recovery, automatically reopen X Messages in a visible browser window, wait for the user to complete it, then retry DM collection. In `--non-interactive` mode, skip DM recovery and record a data gap. The script must not choose, enter, or store the passcode.

## Pages Collected

Default browser pages:

- `home`: home timeline for hotspot detection.
- `own_profile`: the authenticated account profile.
- `mentions_search`: live search for `@handle`.
- `mentions_notifications`: notifications mentions page.
- `messages`: X Messages.

Optional pages:

- `keyword_N`: explicit search queries, only when `--keywords` is provided.

## Run Outputs

Current-run files:

- `twitter-digest/.state/config.json`: account defaults and preferences.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-context.md`: the only normal input for AI daily-summary writing.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-context.json`: machine-readable current-run facts.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-input.*`: raw collector capture for debugging only.

Privacy rule: do not write long-term memory or daily archives. Raw DM text may exist only in the current run's private `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-input.*` and `digest-context.*` files for immediate summarization/debugging. Use only `digest-context.md` for normal final summaries.

Date rule:

- Run dates use the user's local timezone, not UTC.
- Public timeline/profile/mentions facts use a strict `[now - 24 hours, now]` window in the user's current local timezone.
- Public items with missing or unparseable timestamps are excluded from final-summary facts and must be reported as `time-unverified` data gaps.

## Hotspot Detection

Cluster home timeline posts by repeated topics, hashtags, URLs, named entities, accounts, and semantic similarity. Optional keyword-search posts may be included only when the user explicitly passes `--keywords`.

Public timeline, profile, and mentions collection follows the same bounded-window model as DM collection: load enough context for a 24-hour digest, cap the amount passed to the model, and stop early when timestamps show older content. Treat public item counts as browser-loaded items in this run, not exhaustive X history. The generated digest context applies a second strict local-time 24-hour filter before writing final-summary public facts; do not reintroduce older raw-capture items while summarizing.

Mention handling is strict:

- Direct mention/notification collection and handle search (`@handle` / equivalent search page or API recent search) are complementary. Use both sources when available before concluding there are no current mentions or no reply opportunities.
- If one mention source is missing, failed, unavailable, or only returned stale data, report the source status as a data gap and do not turn stale mentions into action items.
- Mentions older than the local 24-hour window must not appear in action items, reply drafts, or the `谁 @ 了你` section.
- Before labeling a mention as needing reply, verify from current-run data whether the authenticated account already replied after the mention timestamp.
- Already-replied mentions should be omitted from action items or marked as already handled.
- If `digest-context.md` includes `reply_state=already_replied` or `action_state=handled`, the mention is not a pending reply. Do not include it in `✅ 该处理` as a reply task.
- If `digest-context.md` includes `reply_state=reply_unverified`, report `回复状态未确认`; do not claim the user definitely needs to reply.
- If reply status cannot be verified, label the mention as `回复状态未确认` instead of claiming the user still needs to reply.

A hotspot needs at least one of:

- Multiple independent posts in the digest window.
- One high-signal post with unusually strong engagement.
- A topic that directly affects the user's projects, brand, customers, portfolio, or community.

For each hotspot, include:

- Topic name.
- Why it is surfacing now.
- Evidence from representative posts when available.
- User relevance.
- Suggested action: monitor, reply, quote, DM, ignore, or investigate.

## Importance Scoring

Score each item from 0 to 100. Use the score to rank, not as false precision.

Suggested weights:

- Direct action requested: +25
- Time sensitivity or deadline: +20
- Reputation, security, legal, finance, or customer risk: +20
- High-relevance relationship or business opportunity: +15
- High-signal author or engagement: +10
- Repeated topic across independent sources: +10
- Spam, vague tag, automated promo, or low-context mention: -20
- Harassment, phishing, or obvious scam: classify separately as risk/ignore.

Classification bands:

- 80-100: urgent
- 60-79: important
- 35-59: routine
- 0-34: ignore/noise

## DM Handling

DMs are private. Count today's visible conversations, but summarize only conversations whose latest preview is not from the user and has real action value. Conversations whose latest preview is `You:` / `You sent` / `你:` should not be presented as action items.

Count fields:

- `dm_visible_thread_count`: today's visible conversation targets found in the DM list.
- `dm_replied_thread_count`: today's visible conversations whose latest list preview appears to be from the user, based on labels such as `You:` / `You sent` / `你:`.
- `dm_unreplied_thread_count`: today's visible conversations waiting for the user's reply, meaning the latest list preview is not from the user.
- `dm_captured_message_count`: captured message bubbles from opened waiting-reply conversations only.
- Per-thread `message_count`: captured message bubbles in that opened conversation.

Do not compare conversation counts and message counts as if they were the same unit. A user can have 5 today visible conversations, 2 waiting-reply conversations, and 4 captured message bubbles across those opened conversations.

The collector opens waiting-reply conversations and scrolls upward before extracting message bubbles. Defaults are `--dm-scrolls 200`, `--dm-max-messages 2000`, and `--dm-window-hours 0`, so it tries to load the full browser-available thread instead of stopping at the 24-hour digest window. If X does not reach the thread top or the message cap is hit, the context records `dm_thread_incomplete`.

Waiting-reply does not automatically mean important. Count every waiting-reply conversation, but summarize only messages that are actionable, relationship-relevant, risky, money/security-sensitive, or clearly useful. Spam, phishing, generic promotion, low-context links, and repeated junk should be classified as ignore/noise and not copied into the main narrative.

For waiting-reply DMs that should be summarized, `digest-context.md` includes a `### DM Thread Context` section with loaded message history, raw thread label, URL, and load metadata. It can include up to 2000 loaded message bubbles per thread. Use it to understand the conversation, but do not copy full private history into the final digest. Keep final DM summaries short and action-oriented.

Media/link context:

- Public items may include `media`, `link`, and `card` lines with image/video URLs, thumbnail URLs, alt text, shared-post links, or external links.
- DM message context may include per-message `link:` and `media:` lines.
- Use these fields to understand whether a post or DM includes a shared post, image, video, or external reference.
- Do not open suspicious links. Do not claim visual details that are not present in the text, alt text, thumbnail URL, or surrounding context.

Status rules:

- `captured_unreplied_threads`: summarize the captured waiting-reply DM bodies selectively and classify importance.
- `no_unreplied_threads`: report the counts and say today's visible DM conversations all have latest previews from the user; do not say there are no DMs.
- `no_today_threads`: say older conversations were visible, but no today conversations were found.
- `visible_threads_unopened`: say the conversation list was visible but waiting-reply message bodies could not be opened; do not infer content.
- `blocked_by_x_chat_passcode`: say DM content is unavailable until the user completes X Chat passcode recovery.

Sender attribution:

- Use the thread `participant` / `会话对象` field and message bubble direction as the DM sender signal.
- Do not treat authors inside quoted posts, repost cards, link previews, or embedded tweet text as DM senders.
- If a conversation with `@jerry` contains a shared post authored by `Marco`, attribute the DM conversation to `@jerry`; mention `Marco` only as the quoted/shared post author if relevant.

Red flags:

- Credential requests, wallet/private-key requests, suspicious links, payment pressure, impersonation.
- Legal threats, press inquiries, customer escalations, partner deadlines.
- People asking for personal data about someone else.

Reply drafting rules:

- Draft replies separately from the summary.
- Keep tone aligned with the user's recent posts if available.
- Do not promise commitments, prices, dates, investments, legal positions, or confidential details unless the user supplied them.
- Ask for approval before sending any reply.
