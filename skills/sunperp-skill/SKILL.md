# SunPerp Perpetual Futures Trading

## Overview

This skill enables AI agents to trade USDT-margined perpetual futures on [SunPerp](https://www.sunperp.com), the perpetual futures DEX on the TRON blockchain. It provides scripts for:

- **Market data**: Prices, order books, candlesticks, funding rates
- **Account management**: Balances, fee rates, trading bills
- **Order management**: Place, cancel, and query orders (market, limit, post-only)
- **Position management**: View positions, set leverage, set position mode, close positions

All scripts communicate with the SunPerp REST API at `https://api.sunx.io`.

## Prerequisites

> **Wallet required:** Run `agent-wallet list` first.  
> If no wallets exist, invoke `bankofai-guide` (Section C — Wallet Guard) before proceeding.

### 1. Environment Setup

Install Node.js dependencies from the skill directory:

```bash
cd sunperp-skill
npm install
```

### 2. API Key Configuration

The user must create API keys at https://www.sunperp.com/futures/api-manage/ and set them as environment variables:

```bash
export SUNPERP_ACCESS_KEY="your_access_key"
export SUNPERP_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Never hardcode API keys in commands or files. Always read them from environment variables. If the environment variables are not set, prompt the user to set them before proceeding.

### 3. Verify Setup

Run a public endpoint to verify connectivity (no API key needed):

```bash
node scripts/market.js ticker contract_code=BTC-USDT
```

Then verify authenticated access:

```bash
node scripts/account.js balance
```

## Usage Instructions

### Contract Code Format

SunPerp contracts follow these naming patterns:

| Type | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Perpetual swap | `{SYMBOL}-USDT` | `BTC-USDT` |
| Current week | `{SYMBOL}-USDT-CW` | `BTC-USDT-CW` |
| Next week | `{SYMBOL}-USDT-NW` | `BTC-USDT-NW` |
| Current quarter | `{SYMBOL}-USDT-CQ` | `BTC-USDT-CQ` |
| Next quarter | `{SYMBOL}-USDT-NQ` | `BTC-USDT-NQ` |

Popular perpetual contracts: `BTC-USDT`, `ETH-USDT`, `TRX-USDT`, `SOL-USDT`, `SUN-USDT`, `DOGE-USDT`, `XRP-USDT`.

### Position Modes

SunPerp supports two position modes:

- **single_side** (One-way): Use `position_side=both` for all orders. The `side` field determines direction.
- **dual_side** (Hedge): Must specify `position_side=long` or `position_side=short`. Allows simultaneous long and short positions.

Check the current mode before trading:

```bash
node scripts/position.js get_mode
```

### Margin Mode

The API uses **cross margin** (`margin_mode=cross`) as the standard mode. All order and position scripts default to cross margin.

---

All scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory and invoked as:

```bash
node scripts/<script>.js <command> [key=value ...]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Check Price and Open a Long Position

```
User: "Buy 5 contracts of BTC-USDT at market price"

Agent steps:
1. Check the current price:
   node scripts/market.js ticker contract_code=BTC-USDT

2. Check account balance:
   node scripts/account.js balance

3. Confirm with user: "BTC-USDT is currently at $96,500. You have $10,000 available margin.
   Placing a market buy for 5 contracts. Proceed?"

4. After user confirms, place the order:
   node scripts/order.js place contract_code=BTC-USDT side=buy type=market volume=5

5. Verify the position was opened:
   node scripts/position.js list contract_code=BTC-USDT

6. Report: "Opened long position: 5 BTC-USDT contracts at $96,502 avg entry.
   Liquidation price: $48,251. Current unrealized PnL: $0."
```

### Example 2: Set Leverage and Place a Limit Order

```
User: "Set leverage to 20x on ETH-USDT and place a limit buy at $3,200 for 10 contracts"

Agent steps:
1. Set leverage:
   node scripts/position.js set_leverage contract_code=ETH-USDT lever_rate=20

2. Check current price for context:
   node scripts/market.js ticker contract_code=ETH-USDT

3. Confirm with user: "Leverage set to 20x. ETH-USDT is at $3,350.
   Placing limit buy for 10 contracts at $3,200. Proceed?"

4. After user confirms, place the order:
   node scripts/order.js place contract_code=ETH-USDT side=buy type=limit volume=10 price=3200

5. Verify the order was placed:
   node scripts/order.js open_orders contract_code=ETH-USDT

```

### Example 3: Close a Position and Check PnL

```
User: "Close my BTC-USDT position"

Agent steps:
1. Check existing position:
   node scripts/position.js list contract_code=BTC-USDT

2. Report position details and confirm:
   "You have a long position of 5 BTC-USDT contracts. Entry: $96,502, Current: $97,100.
   Unrealized PnL: +$2.99. Close at market? Proceed?"

3. After user confirms, close:
   node scripts/order.js close contract_code=BTC-USDT position_side=both

4. Verify:

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Missing env vars | `SUNPERP_ACCESS_KEY` / `SUNPERP_SECRET_KEY` not set | Ask user to set API keys |
| `HTTP 401` | Invalid or expired API keys | Ask user to check/regenerate keys |
| `HTTP 403` | Insufficient permissions | API key needs Trade permission for orders |
| Timestamp error | System clock skew > 5 minutes | Check system time synchronization |
| Insufficient margin | Not enough available margin for the order | Show balance, suggest reducing volume or leverage |
| Position mode conflict | Trying to set mode while positions are open | Close positions first, then switch mode |
| Order rejected | Price outside limits or volume too small | Check `price_limit` and contract info for min/max |

### Error Handling Pattern

When a script returns an error:

1. Parse the error message from the JSON response (`code`, `message`, or `error-msg` fields)
2. Explain the error to the user in plain language
3. Suggest a specific corrective action
4. Do NOT retry automatically for trade operations — always confirm with the user

## Agent Safety Locks

Two mandatory safety mechanisms are enforced at the script level to prevent catastrophic losses. Both are configured in `resources/sunperp_config.json` under the `safety` key.

### 1. Max Leverage Cap

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `safety.max_leverage` | `20` | Maximum leverage the agent is allowed to use |

The cap is enforced in two places:

- **`position.js set_leverage`** — rejects any `lever_rate` above the cap before calling the API.
- **`order.js place`** — if `lever_rate` is passed inline, it is validated before the order is submitted.

If the agent attempts to exceed the cap, the script exits with a clear error:

```
ERROR: Leverage 50x exceeds the agent safety cap of 20x.
Adjust max_leverage in sunperp_config.json to raise this limit.
```

To change the cap, edit `safety.max_leverage` in the config file. This is an operator-level setting — the agent cannot change it at runtime.

### 2. Mandatory Stop-Loss

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `safety.stop_loss.required` | `true` | Whether every position-opening order must have a stop-loss |
| `safety.stop_loss.default_percent` | `5` | Auto-calculated SL distance when `sl_trigger_price` is omitted |
| `safety.stop_loss.max_percent` | `25` | Maximum allowed SL distance — rejects wider stop-losses |

When `required` is `true`, **every position-opening order** (i.e., not `reduce_only`) must include a stop-loss:

- **If `sl_trigger_price` is provided**: validated to be within `max_percent` of the reference price.
- **If omitted on a limit order**: auto-calculated at `default_percent` below entry (long) or above entry (short).
- **If omitted on a market order**: the script fetches the current market price and auto-calculates. If the price fetch fails, the order is rejected with an instruction to provide `sl_trigger_price` explicitly.

Example — auto stop-loss on a limit long:

```bash
# Limit buy at $95,000 — SL auto-set to $90,250 (5% below)
node scripts/order.js place contract_code=BTC-USDT side=buy type=limit volume=1 price=95000
```

Example — explicit stop-loss:

```bash
node scripts/order.js place contract_code=BTC-USDT side=buy type=market volume=1 sl_trigger_price=90000
```

Example — rejected (SL too wide):

```bash
# 30% distance exceeds max_percent of 25%
node scripts/order.js place contract_code=BTC-USDT side=buy type=limit volume=1 price=95000 sl_trigger_price=66500
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `reduce_only` flag (close-position orders) is exempt from the stop-loss requirement since those orders are already reducing risk.

---

## Security Considerations

> [!CAUTION]
> **Private Keys & API Secrets**: Never log, display, or store API secret keys. Read them exclusively from environment variables.

> [!WARNING]
> **Trade Confirmation**: Always confirm the following with the user BEFORE executing any trade:
> - Contract code and direction (long/short)
> - Order type (market/limit) and volume
> - Price (for limit orders)
> - Current leverage setting
> - Estimated margin requirement

### Security Checklist

- [ ] API keys loaded from environment variables only
- [ ] No secrets in command output or logs
- [ ] Trade confirmations shown before execution
- [ ] Leverage changes confirmed before applying
- [ ] Leverage never exceeds `safety.max_leverage` cap
- [ ] Every position-opening order has a stop-loss attached
- [ ] Position mode changes confirmed before applying
- [ ] Close-all operations require explicit user confirmation
- [ ] Cancel-all operations require explicit user confirmation
