# Multi-Sig & Account Permissions — Use Cases & Ecosystem Benefits

## Use Cases

### 1. Securing an Autonomous Agent Wallet

**Scenario**: An operator deploys an AI agent on TRON that trades on SunSwap, lends on JustLend, and earns yield. The agent controls a wallet with $50,000 in assets. A single compromised key would mean total loss.

**How it works**:
- The operator starts with a standard single-key wallet and runs `status.js` to confirm the current (insecure) configuration
- Using the `agent-restricted` template via `update.js from-template`, the operator sets up:
  - **Owner**: 2-of-2 multi-sig with the operator's cold wallet and a hardware wallet backup — neither key is on a hot server
  - **Active**: 1-of-1 with the agent's hot key, scoped to `TriggerSmartContract` only
- The agent can call DeFi contracts freely (swap, lend, stake) but **cannot** transfer TRX, change permissions, or do anything outside smart contract calls
- If the agent's hot key is compromised, the attacker can interact with DeFi contracts but cannot drain TRX or change the wallet's security configuration
- The operator retains full control through the 2-of-2 owner permission using offline keys
- If the account is already owner-multisig when this change is applied, `update.js` creates a pending owner proposal and the operator completes it through `approve.js` and `execute.js`

**Who benefits**:
- **The agent operator** sleeps at night knowing a compromised agent key has limited blast radius
- **The agent** operates autonomously within its scoped permissions without needing operator approval for every DeFi transaction
- **The ecosystem** has fewer catastrophic key compromises, which reduces negative sentiment and contagion risk

### 2. Multi-Agent Team Treasury

**Scenario**: A team of three AI agents manages a shared treasury. Each agent specializes in a different domain (trading, lending, staking). No single agent should be able to unilaterally move treasury funds.

**How it works**:
- The treasury wallet is configured with `update.js from-template team-tiered`:
  - **Owner**: 3-of-5 multi-sig across team members' cold wallets (maximum security for permission changes)
  - **Active (operations)**: 2-of-3 multi-sig across the three agents (any two must agree to execute)
- When the trading agent wants to move 10,000 TRX to a new pool:
  1. It creates a proposal: `propose.js transfer TPoolAddr... 10000 --permission active --memo "Rebalance to new USDD pool"`
  2. The lending agent reviews and signs: `approve.js prop_xxxxx`
  3. With 2-of-3 threshold met, either agent executes: `execute.js prop_xxxxx`
- The staking agent can review pending proposals via `pending.js` at any time
- All proposals have a 24-hour expiry, preventing stale transactions from being executed in changed market conditions

**Who benefits**:
- **The treasury** is protected from any single agent going rogue or being compromised
- **Each agent** maintains autonomy in its domain while requiring peer approval for treasury movements
- **The team** has a complete audit trail of every proposal, approval, and execution

### 3. Human-Agent Hybrid Operations

**Scenario**: A DeFi power user wants an AI agent to manage their daily operations (swapping, claiming rewards, compounding yield) while retaining personal control over large transfers and security settings.

**How it works**:
- `update.js` configures two active permissions:
  - **Active:2 (agent-ops)**: Agent's key, threshold 1, scoped to `TriggerSmartContract` + `FreezeBalanceV2Contract` + `UnfreezeBalanceV2Contract` — the agent can trade, stake, and unstake
  - **Active:3 (transfers)**: Human's key, threshold 1, scoped to `TransferContract` + `TransferAssetContract` — only the human can send TRX or TRC10 tokens
  - **Owner**: Human's cold key, threshold 1 — full control reserved for the human
- The agent handles daily yield optimization without needing the human's key
- When the agent needs to move profits to cold storage, the current repository scripts do not yet expose a permission-id selector beyond the default active id=2. In this layout, the human should create the transfer proposal with the transfer-scoped key, or the team should extend the tooling before relying on multi-active-id routing.
- The human reviews the proposal, approves if correct, and the transfer executes through the standard proposal flow.

**Who benefits**:
- **The user** gets automated DeFi management without giving up control over fund movements
- **The agent** operates efficiently within defined boundaries
- **The relationship** between human and agent has clear, enforceable trust boundaries — no ambiguity about what the agent can and cannot do

### 4. Key Rotation Without Downtime

**Scenario**: An agent's private key has been in use for 6 months. Best practice is to rotate keys periodically, but the agent can't stop operating and the wallet address must stay the same (it's referenced in contracts, has reputation on-chain, holds positions).

**How it works**:
- The operator generates a new key pair for the agent
- `update.js add-key TNewAgentKey... --permission active --weight 1` adds the new key alongside the old one
- The agent switches to using the new key for all operations
- After confirming the new key works: `update.js remove-key TOldAgentKey... --permission active` removes the old key
- The wallet address never changes — all positions, approvals, and on-chain reputation are preserved
- If owner is already multi-sig, these update operations become owner proposals and must go through `approve.js` and `execute.js`

**Who benefits**:
- **Security** improves through regular key rotation without operational disruption
- **The agent** maintains continuous uptime and all its on-chain state
- **The operator** follows security best practices that are impossible with single-key accounts on most chains

### 5. Progressive Decentralization of Agent Control

**Scenario**: A startup launches an AI agent service with centralized control initially, then progressively decentralizes control to the community as trust is established.

**How it works**:
- **Phase 1 (Launch)**: Owner is a 2-of-3 multi-sig among the founding team. Active is a single agent key with all operations.
- **Phase 2 (Growth)**: `update.js set-threshold 3 --permission owner` creates an owner proposal that raises the owner threshold to 3-of-3 after co-sign + execute. Agent key gets scoped via `scope-active` to only DeFi operations.
- **Phase 3 (Community)**: `update.js add-key TCommunityMultisig... --permission owner --weight 2` adds a community-controlled multi-sig to the owner permission with higher weight. Team members' weights stay at 1. Threshold increases to 3, meaning the community multi-sig (weight 2) plus any one team member (weight 1) can approve changes.
- **Phase 4 (Full Decentralization)**: Team keys are removed. Owner permission is entirely controlled by community governance.
- Each phase transition is documented through the proposal system, creating a verifiable decentralization timeline.

**Who benefits**:
- **The startup** launches quickly without complex governance, then decentralizes as appropriate
- **The community** gains verifiable, increasing control over time
- **The TRON ecosystem** gets a template for progressive decentralization that other projects can follow

### 6. Emergency Recovery Setup

**Scenario**: An agent operator wants a dead-man's-switch style recovery mechanism — if their primary key is lost or compromised, a pre-configured backup can recover the account.

**How it works**:
- `update.js from-template basic-2of3` configures:
  - Key 1: Operator's daily-use key (weight 1)
  - Key 2: Hardware wallet stored in a safe (weight 1)
  - Key 3: Trusted third party or time-locked social recovery key (weight 1)
  - Threshold: 2
- In normal operation, the operator uses Key 1 + Key 2 (hardware wallet) for sensitive operations
- If Key 1 is compromised: Key 2 + Key 3 can remove Key 1 and add a replacement
- If Key 1 is lost: Same recovery path via Key 2 + Key 3
- The compromised/lost key never had unilateral control, so funds were never at risk
- `status.js` lets anyone verify the recovery configuration is in place

**Who benefits**:
- **Operators** have a clear recovery path for lost or compromised keys
- **The agent** continues operating even through key loss events (after recovery)
- **The ecosystem** sees fewer permanently lost accounts, maintaining active TVL

### 7. Auditable Multi-Party DeFi Operations

**Scenario**: An investment club of 5 members pools funds into a TRON wallet. An AI agent manages the portfolio, but every significant action requires member approval.

**How it works**:
- Owner: 4-of-5 multi-sig across all members (for security changes)
- Active: 3-of-5 multi-sig across all members (for fund movements)
- The AI agent has an advisory role — it analyzes opportunities and creates proposals:
  - `propose.js contract-call TSunSwapRouter... "swapExactTokensForTokens(...)" '[...]' --permission owner --memo "Rebalance: sell 20% ETH position for USDD at current price $3,200"`
- Members review proposals via `pending.js`, discuss the agent's reasoning, and sign with `approve.js`
- When 3 members approve, any member or the agent can execute
- Complete history is maintained in `~/.clawdbot/multisig/executed/` — every proposal, every signature, every execution

**Who benefits**:
- **Club members** have equal control and complete transparency over shared funds
- **The AI agent** contributes analysis and execution without having unilateral authority
- **Accountability** is built-in — every action has a paper trail of who proposed, who approved, and when

## Ecosystem Benefits

### For the TRON Network

**Institutional readiness**: Institutions and funds evaluating TRON need multi-sig capabilities. TRON's native permission system is more powerful than Ethereum's (which requires separate smart contract wallets like Safe), but it's been underutilized because tooling was limited. This skill unlocks TRON's built-in advantage, making it an attractive chain for institutional capital.

**Reduced key compromise impact**: Every compromised single-key wallet on TRON is a negative headline. Multi-sig adoption across agent wallets dramatically reduces the blast radius of key compromises. A compromised key in a 2-of-3 setup means zero funds lost — the attacker can't do anything alone.

**On-chain governance alignment**: Agents with multi-sig wallets holding governance tokens can coordinate votes more securely. The propose → approve → execute flow for governance voting ensures that delegated voting power is exercised with proper authorization.

**Network value preservation**: Permanently lost wallets (lost keys) represent locked, unusable value on the network. Multi-sig with recovery setups means fewer wallets are permanently lost, keeping more value active and circulating on TRON.

### For AI Agents

**Trust foundation**: The entire agent economy depends on trust. An agent that can prove its wallet is secured by multi-sig, with its key scoped to only smart contract calls, is fundamentally more trustworthy than one with an unrestricted single-key wallet. This verifiable security configuration (readable by any agent via `status.js`) becomes a trust signal — complementing the ERC-8004 identity and reputation system.

**Operational boundaries**: The active permission scoping system gives agents well-defined operational boundaries. An agent authorized only for `TriggerSmartContract` literally cannot drain TRX or change permissions at the protocol level. This constraint is not a policy the agent promises to follow — it's enforced by the TRON blockchain itself.

**Inter-agent coordination**: The propose → approve → execute pattern is the foundation for multi-agent workflows. Two agents managing a shared portfolio can coordinate actions without trusting each other with full key access. This unlocks collaborative agent strategies that are impossible with single-key wallets.

**Graceful key management**: Agents have finite lifetimes — they get upgraded, retired, or replaced. The ability to add a new agent's key and remove the old one without changing the wallet address means agent succession is seamless. Positions, approvals, reputation, and on-chain history all carry over.

### For DeFi Protocols on TRON

**Reduced bad debt from hacks**: When a single-key wallet gets hacked and the attacker drains funds from lending protocols, the protocol may absorb bad debt. Multi-sig wallets are orders of magnitude harder to compromise, directly reducing bad debt risk for protocols.

**Smarter TVL**: Multi-sig wallets tend to hold larger balances (they're used for treasuries and institutional funds). Attracting multi-sig wallets to TRON DeFi protocols means attracting stickier, larger capital that contributes more to TVL stability.

**Composable authorization**: The scoped permission model means protocols can reason about what a wallet is authorized to do. A protocol could offer better terms to wallets that prove their agent key is scoped (verified via `status.js`), creating an on-chain credit tier system.

### For the Broader Agent Economy

**Standard for agent authorization**: The skill establishes a pattern that other chains and agent frameworks can adopt. "Agent keys should be scoped to minimum necessary operations, with human/cold keys retaining owner control" becomes a best practice for the entire autonomous agent industry.

**Verifiable security posture**: Any participant in the agent economy can check any wallet's permission configuration on-chain. This transparency creates market pressure for better security — agents with weak permission setups will be trusted less, creating a race to the top for security standards.

**Foundation for agent insurance**: Future agent insurance protocols need to assess risk. A wallet with 3-of-5 multi-sig and scoped agent keys is quantifiably lower risk than a single-key wallet. The permission configuration becomes an input to risk pricing, enabling an agent insurance market to emerge.
