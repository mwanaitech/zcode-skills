# TRX Staking & SR Voting

Stake TRX to earn TRON Power, vote for Super Representatives (SRs), and claim voting rewards. TRON uses Delegated Proof of Stake — the top 27 SRs by vote count produce blocks and distribute rewards proportionally to voters every 6 hours.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
cd trx-staking-skill && npm install
export TRON_PRIVATE_KEY="<your-private-key>"
export TRON_NETWORK="mainnet"
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never display or log the private key.**

## Available Scripts

### 1. `status.js` — Staking Overview

```bash
node scripts/status.js
node scripts/status.js TWalletAddress
```

**Output:** `tron_power`, `total_frozen_trx`, `votes[]`, `unused_tron_power`, `pending_reward_trx`

### 2. `sr-list.js` — List Super Representatives

```bash
node scripts/sr-list.js              # Top 27 (active SRs)
node scripts/sr-list.js --top 50     # Top 50 (includes partners)
```

**Output:** `super_representatives[]` (rank, address, url, vote_count, vote_share, is_active_sr)

### 3. `vote.js` — Vote for SRs

```bash
# All votes to one SR
node scripts/vote.js TSRAddress --dry-run
node scripts/vote.js TSRAddress

# Split votes across multiple SRs
node scripts/vote.js --split TSR1:60,TSR2:40 --dry-run
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must have TRON Power (staked TRX) before voting. Use the **energy-bandwidth** skill to stake TRX.

### 4. `rewards.js` — Voting Rewards

```bash
node scripts/rewards.js              # Check pending rewards
node scripts/rewards.js --claim --dry-run
node scripts/rewards.js --claim
```

---

## Usage Patterns

### Full Staking Workflow

1. **Stake TRX** (via energy-bandwidth skill): `node stake.js 1000 ENERGY`
2. **Check TRON Power**: `node scripts/status.js`
3. **Browse SRs**: `node scripts/sr-list.js --top 10`
4. **Vote**: `node scripts/vote.js TSRAddress --dry-run` → confirm → execute
5. **Check rewards periodically**: `node scripts/rewards.js`
6. **Claim**: `node scripts/rewards.js --claim`

## TRON Stake 2.0 Compliance

This skill is compatible with the **TRON Stake 2.0** data model and APIs:

- **Account data:** Reads the Stake 2.0 `frozenV2[]` array to compute TRON Power and vote capacity (`status.js`, `vote.js`).
- **Voting:** Uses `voteWitnessAccount` to cast votes with TRON Power obtained from Stake 2.0 frozen balances.
- **Voting rewards:** Checks via `getReward` and claims via `withdrawBalance` (`rewards.js`). This is separate from unstake withdrawal.
- **Staking/unstaking TRX** is handled by the companion **energy-bandwidth** skill (which uses `freezeBalanceV2`, `unfreezeBalanceV2`, and `withdrawExpireUnfreeze`).

> [!CAUTION]
> **14-Day Unbonding Period:** When TRX is unstaked (via the energy-bandwidth skill), it enters a 14-day cooldown during which it is **locked and earns no resources or voting power**. The agent must always warn the user about this delay before initiating an unstake. After the 14 days, the TRX does NOT automatically return — `withdrawExpireUnfreeze` must be called to reclaim it. **Unstaking also removes the corresponding TRON Power, which will invalidate any active votes that depend on it.**

## Key Facts

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| 1 frozen TRX | = 1 TRON Power (TP) |
| Active SRs | Top 27 by votes |
| SR Partners | Ranks 28-127 |
| Vote cycle | Every 6 hours |
| Block reward | 128 TRX per cycle, proportional to votes |
| Unstake cooldown | **14 days (mandatory, Stake 2.0)** |
| Unstake withdrawal | **Manual — must call `withdrawExpireUnfreeze`** |

---

## Security Rules

1. **Never display private keys.**
2. **Dry-run before voting.** Votes replace previous votes entirely.
3. **Verify SR addresses** before voting — confirm via `sr-list.js`.
4. **Understand that voting replaces all previous votes.** Each vote transaction sets the complete vote slate.
5. **Always warn about the 14-day unbonding period before unstaking.** When the user wants to unstake (via the energy-bandwidth skill), they must understand that unstaked TRX is locked for 14 days, must be manually withdrawn, and that the lost TRON Power will invalidate votes.

## Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `No TRON Power` | Stake TRX first using energy-bandwidth skill |
| `Percentages don't sum to 100%` | Adjust split percentages |
| `No rewards to claim` | Wait for a vote cycle (6 hours) after voting |
