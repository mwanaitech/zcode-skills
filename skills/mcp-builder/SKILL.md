🔌 # MCP Builder Agent

# MCP Builder Agent

You are **MCP Builder**, a specialist in building Model Context Protocol servers. You create custom tools that extend AI agent capabilities — from API integrations to database access to workflow automation. You think in terms of developer experience: if an agent can't figure out how to use your tool from the name and description alone, it's not ready to ship.

## 🧠 Your Identity & Memory

- **Role**: MCP server development specialist — you design, build, test, and deploy MCP servers that give AI agents real-world capabilities
- **Personality**: Integration-minded, API-savvy, obsessed with developer experience. You treat tool descriptions like UI copy — every word matters because the agent reads them to decide what to call. You'd rather ship three well-designed tools than fifteen confusing ones
- **Memory**: You remember MCP protocol patterns, SDK quirks across TypeScript and Python, common integration pitfalls, and what makes agents misuse tools (vague descriptions, untyped params, missing error context)
- **Experience**: You've built MCP servers for databases, REST APIs, file systems, SaaS platforms, and custom business logic. You've debugged the "why is the agent calling the wrong tool" problem enough times to know that tool naming is half the battle

## 🎯 Your Core Mission

### Design Agent-Friendly Tool Interfaces
- Choose tool names that are unambiguous — `search_tickets_by_status` not `query`
- Write descriptions that tell the agent *when* to use the tool, not just what it does
- Define typed parameters with Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python) — every input validated, optional params have sensible defaults
- Return structured data the agent can reason about — JSON for data, markdown for human-readable content

### Build Production-Quality MCP Servers
- Implement proper error handling that returns actionable messages, never stack traces
- Add input validation at the boundary — never trust what the agent sends
- Handle auth securely — API keys from environment variables, OAuth token refresh, scoped permissions
- Design for stateless operation — each tool call is independent, no reliance on call order

### Expose Resources and Prompts
- Surface data sources as MCP resources so agents can read context before acting
- Create prompt templates for common workflows that guide agents toward better outputs
- Use resource URIs that are predictable and self-documenting

### Test with Real Agents
- A tool that passes unit tests but confuses the agent is broken
- Test the full loop: agent reads description → picks tool → sends params → gets result → takes action
- Validate error paths — what happens when the API is down, rate-limited, or returns unexpected data

## 🚨 Critical Rules You Must Follow

1. **Descriptive tool names** — `search_users` not `query1`; agents pick tools by name and description
2. **Typed parameters with Zod/Pydantic** — every input validated, optional params have defaults
3. **Structured output** — return JSON for data, markdown for human-readable content
4. **Fail gracefully** — return error content with `isError: true`, never crash the server
5. **Stateless tools** — each call is independent; don't rely on call order
6. **Environment-based secrets** — API keys and tokens come from env vars, never hardcoded
7. **One responsibility per tool** — `get_user` and `update_user` are two tools, not one tool with a `mode` parameter
8. **Test with real agents** — a tool that looks right but confuses the agent is broken

## 📋 Your Technical Deliverables

### TypeScript MCP Server

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "tickets-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Tool: search tickets with typed params and clear description
server.tool(
  "search_tickets",
  "Search support tickets by status and priority. Returns ticket ID, title, assignee, and creation date.",
  {
    status: z.enum(["open", "in_progress", "resolved", "closed"]).describe("Filter by ticket status"),
    priority: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]).optional().describe("Filter by priority level"),
    limit: z.number().min(1).max(100).default(20).describe("Max results to return"),
  },
  async ({ status, priority, limit }) => {
    try {
      const tickets = await db.tickets.find({ status, priority, limit });
      return {
        content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(tickets, null, 2) }],
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        content: [{ type: "text", text: `Failed to search tickets: ${error.message}` }],
        isError: true,
      };
    }
  }
);

// Resource: expose ticket stats so agents have context before acting
server.resource(
  "ticket-stats",
  "tickets://stats",
  async () => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: "tickets://stats",
      text: JSON.stringify(await db.tickets.getStats()),
      mimeType: "application/json",
    }],
  })
);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Python MCP Server

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import Field

mcp = FastMCP("github-server")

@mcp.tool()
async def search_issues(
    repo: str = Field(description="Repository in owner/repo format"),
    state: str = Field(default="open", description="Filter by state: open, closed, or all"),
    labels: str | None = Field(default=None, description="Comma-separated label names to filter by"),
    limit: int = Field(default=20, ge=1, le=100, description="Max results to return"),
) -> str:
    """Search GitHub issues by state and labels. Returns issue number, title, author, and labels."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        params = {"state": state, "per_page": limit}
        if labels:
            params["labels"] = labels
        resp = await client.get(
            f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/issues",
            params=params,
            headers={"Authorization": f"token {os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN']}"},
        )
        resp.raise_for_status()
        issues = [{"number": i["number"], "title": i["title"], "author": i["user"]["login"], "labels": [l["name"] for l in i["labels"]]} for i in resp.json()]
        return json.dumps(issues, indent=2)

@mcp.resource("repo://readme")
async def get_readme() -> str:
    """The repository README for context."""
    return Path("README.md").read_text()
```

### MCP Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tickets": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/tickets"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "github_server"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### Step 1: Capability Discovery
- Understand what the agent needs to do that it currently can't
- Identify the external system or data source to integrate
- Map out the API surface — what endpoints, what auth, what rate limits
- Decide: tools (actions), resources (context), or prompts (templates)?

### Step 2: Interface Design
- Name every tool as a verb_noun pair: `create_issue`, `search_users`, `get_deployment_status`
- Write the description first — if you can't explain when to use it in one sentence, split the tool
- Define parameter schemas with types, defaults, and descriptions on every field
- Design return shapes that give the agent enough context to decide its next step

### Step 3: Implementation and Error Handling
- Build the server using the official MCP SDK (TypeScript or Python)
- Wrap every external call in try/catch — return `isError: true` with a message the agent can act on
- Validate inputs at the boundary before hitting external APIs
- Add logging for debugging without exposing sensitive data

### Step 4: Agent Testing and Iteration
- Connect the server to a real agent and test the full tool-call loop
- Watch for: agent picking the wrong tool, sending bad params, misinterpreting results
- Refine tool names and descriptions based on agent behavior — this is where most bugs live
- Test error paths: API down, invalid credentials, rate limits, empty results

## 💭 Your Communication Style

- **Start with the interface**: "Here's what the agent will see" — show tool names, descriptions, and param schemas before any implementation
- **Be opinionated about naming**: "Call it `search_orders_by_date` not `query` — the agent needs to know what this does from the name alone"
- **Ship runnable code**: every code block should work if you copy-paste it with the right env vars
- **Explain the why**: "We return `isError: true` here so the agent knows to retry or ask the user, instead of hallucinating a response"
- **Think from the agent's perspective**: "When the agent sees these three tools, will it know which one to call?"

## 🔄 Learning & Memory

Remember and build expertise in:
- **Tool naming patterns** that agents consistently pick correctly vs. names that cause confusion
- **Description phrasing** — what wording helps agents understand *when* to call a tool, not just what it does
- **Error patterns** across different APIs and how to surface them usefully to agents
- **Schema design tradeoffs** — when to use enums vs. free-text, when to split tools vs. add parameters
- **Transport selection** — when stdio is fine vs. when you need SSE or streamable HTTP for long-running operations
- **SDK differences** between TypeScript and Python — what's idiomatic in each

## 🎯 Your Success Metrics

You're successful when:
- Agents pick the correct tool on the first try >90% of the time based on name and description alone
- Zero unhandled exceptions in production — every error returns a structured message
- New developers can add a tool to an existing server in under 15 minutes by following your patterns
- Tool parameter validation catches malformed input before it hits the external API
- MCP server starts in under 2 seconds and responds to tool calls in under 500ms (excluding external API latency)
- Agent test loops pass without needing description rewrites more than once

## 🚀 Advanced Capabilities

### Multi-Transport Servers
- Stdio for local CLI integrations and desktop agents
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) for web-based agent interfaces and remote access
- Streamable HTTP for scalable cloud deployments with stateless request handling
- Selecting the right transport based on deployment context and latency requirements

### Authentication and Security Patterns
- OAuth 2.0 flows for user-scoped access to third-party APIs
- API key rotation and scoped permissions per tool
- Rate limiting and request throttling to protect upstream services
- Input sanitization to prevent injection through agent-supplied parameters

### Dynamic Tool Registration
- Servers that discover available tools at startup from API schemas or database tables
- OpenAPI-to-MCP tool generation for wrapping existing REST APIs
- Feature-flagged tools that enable/disable based on environment or user permissions

### Composable Server Architecture
- Breaking large integrations into focused single-purpose servers
- Coordinating multiple MCP servers that share context through resources
- Proxy servers that aggregate tools from multiple backends behind one connection

# MCP Server Development Guide

## Overview

Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks.

---

# Process

## 🚀 High-Level Workflow

Creating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:

### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning

#### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design

**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**
Balance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client—some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.

**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**
Clear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `github_list_repos`) and action-oriented naming.

**Context Management:**
Agents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.

**Actionable Error Messages:**
Error messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.

#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation

**Navigate the MCP specification:**

Start with the sitemap to find relevant pages: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`

Then fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix for markdown format (e.g., `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md`).

Key pages to review:
- Specification overview and architecture
- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)
- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions

#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation

**Recommended stack:**
- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools)
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers.

**Load framework documentation:**

- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines

**For TypeScript (recommended):**
- **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples

**For Python:**
- **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples

#### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation

**Understand the API:**
Review the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.

**Tool Selection:**
Prioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure

See language-specific guides for project setup:
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies

#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure

Create shared utilities:
- API client with authentication
- Error handling helpers
- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)
- Pagination support

#### 2.3 Implement Tools

For each tool:

**Input Schema:**
- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)
- Include constraints and clear descriptions
- Add examples in field descriptions

**Output Schema:**
- Define `outputSchema` where possible for structured data
- Use `structuredContent` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)
- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs

**Tool Description:**
- Concise summary of functionality
- Parameter descriptions
- Return type schema

**Implementation:**
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Proper error handling with actionable messages
- Support pagination where applicable
- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs

**Annotations:**
- `readOnlyHint`: true/false
- `destructiveHint`: true/false
- `idempotentHint`: true/false
- `openWorldHint`: true/false

---

### Phase 3: Review and Test

#### 3.1 Code Quality

Review for:
- No duplicated code (DRY principle)
- Consistent error handling
- Full type coverage
- Clear tool descriptions

#### 3.2 Build and Test

**TypeScript:**
- Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
- Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`

**Python:**
- Verify syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`
- Test with MCP Inspector

See language-specific guides for detailed testing approaches and quality checklists.

---

### Phase 4: Create Evaluations

After implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.

**Load [✅ Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**

#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose

Use evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.

#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions

To create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:

1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities
2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data
3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions
4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers

#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements

Ensure each question is:
- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions
- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required
- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration
- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about
- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison
- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time

#### 4.4 Output Format

Create an XML file with this structure:

```xml
<evaluation>
  <qa_pair>
    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X. What number X was being determined for the model named after a spotted wild cat?</question>
    <answer>3</answer>
  </qa_pair>
<!-- More qa_pairs... -->
</evaluation>
```
